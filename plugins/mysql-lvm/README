This plugin provides functionality to perform LVM snapshots for a MYSQL
database. This includes optionally quiescing MyISAM tables to disk via
FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK, obtaining binary log information as well as
running through InnoDB recovery at backup time.

Backup format is a (optionally compressed) tar archive using GNU tar.
